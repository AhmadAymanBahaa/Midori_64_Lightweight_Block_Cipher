# Midori_64 Lightweight Block Cipher

### This notebook contains a guided clear inspection & implementation of the Midori64 cyphering algorithm, where the paper is submitted [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1142.pdf).

### Included in this notebook:


1.   Implementation. 
2.   Test Suite for each of the methods. 
3.   A cypher/decypher full round using the midori64 algorithm. 

Note that all figures & diagrams were obtained from the original referenced paper. 

## Milestone 1: 6th June 2021

## Milestone Description
This notebook presents the collaborative efforts we have reached to so far. This is the first milestone where we have achieved the following tasks:

1.   Read & Inspect the research paper
2.   Divide up the workload of deeply understanding each module of the cypher
3.   Tasking & Responsibilities:
### Ahmad Ayman:
   #### - Implementing & Running unit tests
   #### - Specifications for each module to facilitate the merging efforts 
   #### - Consolidating Efforts of each member 
   #### - Implementing Round Function 
### Fatema Hassan:
   #### - She was the one responsible for presenting an overview of the research paper at first
   #### - Test Case specification 
   #### - Implementing Shuffle Cell Module
### Hossam Hatem:
   #### - Researched & Presented another algorithm at the early point of discussion 
   #### - Implementing the MixColumn Module
### Mariam Salah:
   #### - Implementing the SubCell Module
   #### - Helping with the Round Function
### Nadine Shalaby:
   #### - Researching which language would facilitate the algorithm implementation by implementing & presenting one of the modules with both C & Python languages
   #### - Implementing the KeyAdd Module
   #### - Implementing the KeyGeneration Module
